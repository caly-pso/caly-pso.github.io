# Layout

###### [(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

[![Picture](#)](#layout)

A simple one-page layout for the portfolio to ensure ease of use and a uniform experience.

Included are:
A Navbar
Projects Section
About Section
Resume Section
Footer Section

Each section is separated with a title and a 'back-to-top' button persists throughout the page. The navbar also remains at the top of the page for quick navigation to different sections on the page. The goal was a create a simple but informative website.
