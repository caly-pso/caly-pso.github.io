Hi there! ðŸ™Œ

My name is Calypso Rynkowski and I want to welcome you to my portfolio! A little about me:

I am a student of Anthropology and graduated with my bachelor's from the University of Texas at San Antonio. I have a passion for learning and a drive to find the connections hidden behind words, data, and code. Moving forward in my career, I look forward to use technology and software to help me discover patterns, answer questions, and learn more about the world.

Coming from a non-traditional path, I have spent the last year immersing myself in coding with Python, creating databases, and applying analytical methods to explore data, in order to understand both how software works, and how it can be utilized.
