# My Porfolio

## Background
Hi there!

My name is Calypso Rynkowski and I want to welcome you to my porfolio! A little about me:

I was a student of Anthropology and graduated with my bachelor's from the University of Texas at San Antonio. While in college, I focused on pre-medicine, completing over 40 hours in science, and 17 hours in mathmatics courses, where I fell in love with data and statistics. At the time, I knew my future lay in how I could apply analyzing data, into actionable results, but where to start? 




Included on the website is basics about me including:

- Projects
- My Resume
- Skills

I created this Bootstrap website to showcase my projects, education, and work history. Check it out here:
